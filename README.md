Create a small PHP-script to accomplish following parts:  Part-1: Album Slideshow      User visits your script page     User will be asked to connect using his FB account     Once authenticated, your script will pull his album list from FB     User will click on an album name/thumbnail     A jQuery-slideshow will start showing photos in that album (in full-screen mode)  Part-2: Download Album      Beside every album icon (step #4 in part-1), add a new icon/button saying “Download This Album”     When the user clicks on that button, your script will fetch all photos in that album behind the scene and zip them inside a folder on server.     You may start a “progress bar” as soon as user-click download button as download process may take time.     Once zip building on server completes, show user link to zip file.     When user clicks zip-file link, it will download zip folder without opening any new page.     Beside album names, add a checkbox. Then add a common “Download Selected Album” button. This button will download selected albums in a zip. Zip will contain one folder for each album. Folder-name will be album-name. Inside folder, content for that album will be present.     Also, add a big “Download ALL” button. This button will download all albums in a zip. Similar to above.
